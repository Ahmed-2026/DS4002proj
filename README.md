## Documentation Map
DS4002PROJ
- `README.md`: This file
- `LICENSE`: Description of the license for this project
- üìÅ Data Folder: contains data used throughout the pipeline
  - `METADATA.md`: Description of the data being used
  - `yelp_part1.feather`...`yelp_part4.feather`: Raw Yelp review dataset (full dataset split into 4 files, tracked with Git LFS)
  - `yelp_sample_250k.csv`: Sample of 250k reviews (for improved processing speeds, used for quick testing and debugging)
  - `yelp_with_sentiment.csv`: Reviews with analyzed sentiment labels/strengths, output from sentiment script (produced by running `1_sentiment.py` on the sample)
  - Note: Running `1_sentiment.py` on the full dataset produces many intermediate files (`sentiment_chunk_*.feather`) which are merged into a larger sentiment dataset. These chunk files are not committed due to size, but the workflow is included.

## How to Reproduce Results
[In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty.]
