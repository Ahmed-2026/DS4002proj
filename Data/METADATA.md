## Data Summary
Our dataset is a .json file from Yelp, a popular business review website. It contains data from over 6 million reviews across over 150 thousand businesses, including the number of stars and text description of each review. The dataset is provided by Yelp, Inc. specifically for academic and research purposes. It is widely used in natural language processing studies and sentiment analysis research, and it has become a standard dataset for testing new models in this domain. It includes json files for businesses, users, reviews, tips, and photos. Within the reviews dataset, which is the relevant dataset for our research question, each review has a unique ID, the user ID of who left the review, the business ID of the business that received the review, the number of stars given, the date the review was left, the text of the review itself, and the number of useful, funny, and cool votes the review received from other users.

## Provenance

## License

## Ethical Statements
Since the Yelp reviews are publicly available, we will comply fully with Yelp’s license and terms of use. No attempt will be made to deanonymize users of link reviews to personal identities. The data we are using is only coming from Yelp’s official public datasets. Only data necessary for the research question will be used for analysis, as to avoid any exposure of sensitive data.
